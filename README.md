# cobbler-extractor
A tool to extract existing configuration data into a shell script of commands to use in a clean install.

**NOTE**: This was designed for exporting from cobbler 2.x and running against the same. Exporting from Cobbler 2.8 and into 3.3 currently results in errors, which are being resolved.
